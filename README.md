 # 🧬 Cross-Chain Inheritance Vault (CIV)

 The **Cross-Chain Inheritance Vault (CIV)** is a decentralized platform designed to help users **securely plan, manage, and automate the inheritance and recovery of their crypto assets** across multiple blockchain networks.

 This project aims to solve real-world issues like forgotten keys, lost wallets, and the lack of structured digital asset inheritance by offering a smart contract-based solution with advanced security, cross-chain compatibility, and user-centric features.
