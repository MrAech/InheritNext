# Civ Frontend (dev)

This frontend provides minimal UI pages to record token approvals and register vaulted NFTs and demonstrates calling the backend canister in both local (dfx) and onâ€‘IC environments.

Prerequisites
- Node 18+ and npm
- DFX installed and configured (https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/)

Local development (dfx)

1) Start the local replica and deploy canisters:

```bash
# start the local replica (in another terminal)
dfx start --background
# create & deploy canisters
dfx deploy --no-wallet
```

2) Inject the backend canister id into the frontend environment. The frontend expects a variable named `VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID`.

You can copy the local canister id from `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json` into a `.env` file at the frontend root (or the workspace root) like:

```bash
# example: .env in src/civ_frontend
VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID="ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
```

dfx's build step can also populate canister ids for production builds; for local dev the `.env` approach is simplest.

3) Install and run the frontend dev server:

```bash
cd src/civ_frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

4) Open the app in your browser. Use the app's Sign In flow (Internet Identity) to authenticate. The frontend uses `@dfinity/auth-client` and will create an authenticated agent for actor calls.

Notes and behavior
- The frontend actor (`src/civ_frontend/src/lib/actor.ts`) resolves the backend canister id in this order:
	1. `process.env.VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID` (recommended for dfx builds)
	2. `window.__CIV_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID` (optional override for hosting)
- The actor uses `@dfinity/auth-client` to log in with Internet Identity and recreates the HttpAgent with the user's identity so calls from the UI are authenticated.
- For local dev (non-production) the agent fetches the root key to validate candid responses from the local replica. This is skipped in production builds.
- The backend uses canonical ICRC ledger methods (e.g., `icrc1_transfer`, `icrc2_transfer_from`) and when running locally the `.dfx` service DID contains these signatures so calls will match the local ledger canister.

Troubleshooting
- If you see an error about missing `VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID`, confirm you copied the canister id into `.env` or exposed it via the hosting page by setting `window.__CIV_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID`.
- If actor calls fail with candid decoding errors when running local, ensure `dfx start` is running and you deployed the canisters with `dfx deploy`.

Extending for production
- When building for production, arrange your build pipeline to inject the real backend canister id into the frontend build (the variable name `VITE_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID` is used by the Vite build step). dfx's `dfx deploy` and `dfx generate` steps can help automate this.

This README focuses on developer workflows; update and extend these instructions for your CI/CD and production hosting environment.
